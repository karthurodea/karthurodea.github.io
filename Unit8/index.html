			<p>I grew up in Arlington, Vermont, a town with just over 2300 people. Our claim to fame is an association with <a href="https://www.biography.com/people/norman-rockwell-37249">Norman Rockwell,</a>who lived in Arlington from 1939-1953.</p><p>Between the ages of 10 and 18 I spent all my time playing soccer, basketball, and baseball. I wish I could weave together a more interesting series of events, but as the seasons changed I transitioned from one sport to the next.</p>

			<p>My parents stopped funding my social escapades when I entered high school, so I started working on the weekends.  Luckily, the town of Manchester was only a ten minute car ride from Arlington.  At 14 I tried caddying, and got pissed about sitting in a shack for four hours without getting paid. At 15 I folded clothes at Brooks Brothers for a dazzling $8/hr. At 16 I hit the jackpot as a food artist at Bagel Works (now The Works Bakery and Cafe).</p>

		<img class="imgframe" src="images/HC.png" alt="Holy Cross">
		<p>I left Vermont for Holy Cross College in Massachusetts, which boasts a student body of 2900, a little larger than the population of my hometown. Toward the end of high school baseball had become my primary pursuit, and I found my way <a href="http://www.goholycross.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=33100&ATCLID=210220687">onto the college baseball team as a walk-on.</a> Freshman year was lots of ups and downs, strikes and gutters; I struggled to balance coursework unlike anything I experienced in high school with the daily pain and discomfort of division I baseball (and a deep desire to learn every bar in Worcester).</p>

		<p>After two years of dormitory living and dining hall cuisine (and a <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2005/4/7/baseball-dealt-heartbreak-at-home-holy/?page=1">career-defining win at Harvard</a>) I moved off campus with 7 baseball teammates and 2 friends-of-the-program to 125 College Street, where we spent our remaining two years staving off graduation, patronizing Wendy's drive-thru, and entertaining classmates.  I love this picture because it is NOTHING like the condition of the house during my tenancy.  I couldn't find a picture of the exterior, but do your best to imagine the worst, then add ten additional degrees of worst.</p>

		<img class="imgframe" src="images/EDQ.png" alt="Experian Data Quality">
		<p>I graduated from Holy Cross with a degree in English, and spent the next five months living with my aunt and uncle in Chelmsford seeking employment. My first employer - <a href="https://www.edq.com/">Experian QAS</a> - tapped my formal understanding of the English language, paying me to sell mailing address validation software to local, state, and federal government agencies in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Arkansas. After a couple months of gainful employment, I moved to Allston and rented an apartment with a college roommate. I consider this a transitional moment in my history, moving from the comfort and security of living with family, to the struggle of independence, and a paycheck-to-paycheck modus operandi.</p>

			<img class="imgframe" src="images/bowdoingroup.jpg" alt="Bowdoin Group">
			<p>Whilst employed at Experian I relocated from Allston to Charlestown, and shared an excellent two-bedroom with a new roommate (a friend of a friend).  Shortly after the reloaction I parted ways with Experian and software sales, and got my first and last taste of contract staffing at <a href="https://www.bowdoingroup.com/">Bowdoin Group</a>. I started at BG in January 2009, and left BG in January 2010.</p>

		<img class="imgframe" src="images/forrester.png" alt="Forrester Research">
		<p>When I left the Bowdoin Group I was concerned the last year had been a waste.  However, the time I spent cold-calling and pushing past frequent rejection became a valuable asset.  I worked my way through the interview process at <a href="https://go.forrester.com/">Forrester Research</a> and received an offer to work in their account management department.  One of the people on the interview panel at Forrester came from the staffing world, and I think my experience at the Bowdoin Group was a big driver in the decision to offer me the job.  The role was supporting two senior account directors and the ~20 enterprise clients they managed.</p>

		<img class="imgframe" src="images/Waltham.png" alt="Welcome to Waltham">
		<p>The transition from The Bowdoin Group to Forrester coincided with an address change.  I moved out of Charlestown and into Waltham with a new rooomate (who went on to become my wife Briana) and a desire to reduce living expenses.  Bri and I met through mutual friends in 2009; we moved in together in 2010; we got married in 2012; we welcomed a daughter, Audrey, in 2015; and later this year we're expecting Audrey's first sibling.</p>

		<p>Working at Forrester was excellent.  I was exposed to so many smart people, and an enormous library of high quality research and data.  To this day I have a great deal of respect for each manager and account director for whom I worked.  The decision to leave was not driven by a desire to leave Forrester; it was <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/">HubSpot's</a> appeal as a fast-growing tech company, and the opportunity to learn the ins and outs of a budding marketing automation platform.  I left Forrester at the end of June 2014, and started at HubSpot a week later on July 7th.</p>

		<p>I remain happily employed at HubSpot today, and <a href="https://karthurodea.github.io/Unit6/index.html">this website</a> is one example of the rewarding work experience.  HubSpot is covering the cost of my participation in GA's HTML/CSS circuit, and this is just one example of the many perks of being an employee.  Another is stock options, and stock units, which have helped Bri and I purchase our first home in Littleton.  I'm sitting in my home office finishing this final paragraph, looking fondly back at the last ~33 years, and looking eagerly ahead at the next.</p>
