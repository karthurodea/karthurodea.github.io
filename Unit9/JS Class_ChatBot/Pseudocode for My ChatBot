Pseudocode for My ChatBot

// add an event listener to the form to submit Dave's message

// create a function for HAL to respond to Dave's messages with variable logic based upon Dave's inputs

// create a function for HAL to open the chat with "Good morning, Dave"

// invoke the opening message


Question 1 = "Hal, what day is it?"
Answer 1 = "Today is {day of the week function}"

Question 2 = "Hal, who is in the JSR-508 Class?"
Answer 2 = "The students enrolled in JSR-508 are: {class roster function}

Question 3 = "Hal, please eliminate someone from the JSR-508 Class"
Answer 3 = "Ok, I've removed {random classmate function} from JSR-508"

<script>
document.addEventListener("click", function(){
    document.getElementById("hal").innerHTML = "Good Morning, Dave";
});
</script>

LINE 27 in INDEX.HTML =   <script src="js/main.js"></script>


if (chat == "Hal, what day is today?") {
    document.getElementById('hal').innerHTML += "todayIs()";



<script>
function todayIs(){
var d = new Date();
var text = "Today is ";
var today = (text + d);
console.log (today);
}
</script>



Goal 2:  Share the list of class mates 

//if the user asks "Hal, who is in the JSR-508 Class?""
//respond with the class roster

if (chat == "Hal, who is in the JSR-508 Class?") {
    document.getElementById('hal').innerHTML += "classRoster()";

<script>
function classRoster() {
var classRoster = ["Sonyl", "Courtney", "Kevin", "Alex", "Alexis", "Andrew", "Bernardo", "Brandon", "Colburn", "Courtney P", "David", "Diana", "Ejaz", "Joana", "Josh", "Kaitlyn", "Kalynne", "Katie", "Myriam", "Nikki", "Tenny", "Timothy"];
var text = "The students enrolled in JSR-508 are: ";
var i;
for (i = 0; i < classRoster.length; i++) {
    text += classRoster[i] + ", ";
}
}
</script>

use random component in the selector of the class roster and say, 'Hey random person, Hal is going to ___ you.'

randomly select someone and eliminate them from class. 

Goal 3:
